# Sketchware Manager

Coroutine-based library for managing sketchware projects, collections and etc.

## Projects ðŸ“‚

The library supports Sketchware, Sketchware Pro projects âœ”

### Example:

```kotlin
val manager = SketchwareProjects("../.sketchware")
manager.getProjects().forEach { project ->
    when(project) {
        is SketchwareProject -> println("I am a sketchware project")
        is SketchwareProProject -> println("I am a sketchware pro project")
    }
}
```

Also, an instance of the SketchwarePro class, for example, has its own functionality only for it:

```kotlin
val project = manager.getProjects()[0] as SketchwareProProject // only as example :)
println(project.getProguardRules()) // prints proguard rules in project
project.setProguardRules("..") // sets proguard rules
// and another funcs..
```
